## Shopify Backend Challenge

Hello! In this repository is my submission to the Shopify Backend Intern Challenge.

This application allows users to upload images with a title, text body, categories and tags and also update, read and delete their image repository. The application features full user authentication and authroization and also features a social Google login. Additionally, users can contact one another through email using the contact forms and can discuss images through the DISQUS commenting system.

## Start the Application

To start the application clone the repository and then set up Mongo DB on your computer.

After this open a terminal and go to the backend folder and type the command

```
npm start
```

then in a serpate terminal go to the frontend folder and run

```
npm run dev
```

The application will then run on localhost:3000
